### Creating Content

All content is written plain in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files and is stored inside `page/content/[CONTENT-TYPE]`. 

The only thing special is that these files also contain some meta information in the header of the page. For this a basic YAML notation is used. This leads to a structure that looks something like this:

```
---
key1: 'value1'
key2: 'value2'
...: '...'
---

_Markdown_ formatted content from here to eternity...

```

No matter which content type, they all look and behave exactly like this. Everything else is either happening in the corresponding template or controlled through a specific key.
